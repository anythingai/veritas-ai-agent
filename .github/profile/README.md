> Building the future of AI trust and verification

## About Us

We're building **Veritas AI Agent**, a real-time trust layer for AI that grounds large language model output in verifiable, cryptographically-signed source documents stored on IPFS.

## 🚀 Our Mission

Transform AI from creative storytellers into trusted assistants by providing real-time fact verification with cryptographic proof.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, React, Chrome Extensions
- **Backend**: Node.js, Fastify, PostgreSQL
- **AI/ML**: Python, FastAPI, OpenAI, Sentence Transformers
- **Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, ArgoCD
- **Storage**: IPFS, PostgreSQL, Redis
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, Loki

## 📊 Key Metrics

- **Verification Speed**: ≤300ms for 90% of claims
- **Accuracy**: ≥90% precision on fact-checking
- **Scalability**: 10k+ concurrent verifications
- **Uptime**: 99.9% SLA

## 🌟 Featured Project
